# IC24_FrontToBack

In this program, you will be writing Java code to read input from a text file (one line at a time) and then moving the first word (front) of the line to the end (back) and writing the new line to an output text file.  For example, if the line in the input file is "try to check if the movie can make you cry" then your code would move "try" from the front to the back of this line to become "to check if the movie can make you cry try".

Here are the specifics:

Write a Java console application that opens a text file (named Input.txt) and reads one line of input at a time.  Split the line of input whenever there are spaces (" ") into a String array of words.  Then, use the String array to move the front (first word) to the back (last word) and write the new line to another text file (named Output.txt).  You will find the input file attached to this in-class assignment.
